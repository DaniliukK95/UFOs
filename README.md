# UFO Sightings with JavaScript
Module 11 – Challenge – Deliverable 2

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to improve the webpage we originally created in the module. The original webpage allowed users to filter search results based on date of UFO sightings. In this challenge we added four more filters to the webpage to allow for more precise and other options for filters. Now a user can filter based off date, city, state, country and or shape. A user can choose to use only one of these criteria, or multiple. 

## Results
When the webpage is first opened, we are shown the homepage with all the information. The title of the webpage is the first item located on the top of the webpage. After comes to the article title and article paragraph next to each other.

A user will scroll down until they see “Filter Search” with the filters and their titles. To the right of the filters, a user will see the sightings that come up. This is how the section looks like:

![Filter](https://github.com/DaniliukK95/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filter%20search.png)

On the left, where the white boxes are, is where the user will type the filters they want, in the appropriate boxes. Once they do so, the page will automatically refresh and display the sightings on the right-hand side. It will provide the information displayed as column titles. On the old webpage, the user could only use one filter, now they can choose from up to five filters. 

## Summary
### Drawbacks:
One drawback of this new design is that the filters are very specific. This means that if you type circle, but round is how the sighting is described, the sighting will not come up. The users search must be specific. Also with this many filters, it can make it difficult to find any information. 
### Recommendations:
One recommendation to the issue described above, is to implement recommendations that come up so a user can see some of the available filter options. This way if they see a word that might be close to what they’re looking for, they won’t miss it and the sighting connected to it. 
Another recommendation is to provide more information such as links to the sightings and a way to add more information that comes out. This webpage is only limited to the data we put in, and only what we have provided.
